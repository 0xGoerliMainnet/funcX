    "# funcX Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "funcX is a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform for science that enables you to convert almost any computing resource into a high-performance function serving device. To do this, you deploy a funcX endpoint agent on the resource, which integrates it into the function serving fabric, allowing you to dynamically send, monitor, and receive results from function invocations. funcX is built on top of [Parsl](https://parsl-project.org), enabling a funcX endpoint to use large compute resources via traditional batch queues, where funcX will dynamically provision, use, and release resources on-demand to fulfill function requests. The function service fabric, which is run centrally as a service, is hosted in AWS.\n",

    "- Register containers and execution environments\n",
    "- Launch registered functions against endpoints\n",
    "- Check the status of launched functions\n",

    "#### Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Instantiating a client will force an authentication flow where you will be asked to authenticate with Globus Auth. Every interaction with funcX is authenticated to allow us to enforce access control on both functions and endpoints. As part of the authentication process we request access to your identity information (to retrieve your email address), Globus Groups management access, and Globus Search. We require Groups access in order to facilitate sharing.  Globus Search allows funcX to add your functions to a searchable registry and make them discoverable to permitted users (as well as yourself!).  "
