Endpoints
=========

An endpoint is a persist service launched by the user on their compute facility's login
that serves as a conduit for routing tasks to their compute facility.

The endpoint can be configured to connect up to the funcX webservice at `funcx.org <https://funcx.org>`_
or to your private service. Once the endpoint is connected, the web portal presents available
endpoints to which you can direct functions.
