# TODO: remove all of these ignores other than W503,W504,B008
# `black` will handle enforcement of styling, and we will have no opinionated
# ignore rules
# any cases in which we actually need to ignore a rule (e.g. E402) we will mark
# the relevant segment with noqa comments as necessary
#
# D203: 1 blank line required before class docstring
# E124: closing bracket does not match visual indentation
# E126: continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# F403: ‘from module import *’ used; unable to detect undefined names
# F405: name may be undefined, or defined from star imports: module
# Ignoring the next one for valid tests
# F811: redefinition of unused name from line N
# This one is bad. Sometimes ordering matters, conditional imports
# setting env vars necessary etc.
# E402: module level import not at top of file
# E129: Visual indent to not match indent as next line, counter eg here:
# https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/386
#
# E203,W503,W504: conflict with black formatting sometimes
# B008: a flake8-bugbear rule which fails on idiomatic typer usage (consider
# re-enabling this once everything else is fixed and updating usage)
